# Dualfish Interpreter

Written by LandonThePancake in Python v3.12

<h2>Info</h2>
Dualfish is a esoteric programming language heavily inspired by another language named "deadfish". This language aims to add more to deadfish with the goal of making it slightly more interesting (whilst also making no god damn sense). 'Dual'fish gets its name from having two registers to work with instead of just one like deadfish. It really doesn't take rocket science to find out where the 'fish' part came from.
This is my first interpreter, and it definitely shows with how the code is structured, But im pretty proud of what i was able to pull off.

<h2>Type 'help' in the interpreter to get a list of what you can do</h2>
Currently rewriting the documentation, it will come back with the release of v0.8 of the interpreter
